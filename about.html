        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>I recently discovered the pre-retirement hobby of oil painting. I've taken a lot of instruction from various

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>Computer sciences have been a hobby of mine since high school. I am not a developer by any means, but I do
          continuously try to learn new languages. In fact, this website was built by me. Some people find coding to be
          tedious, but the thrill of making it work is exciting to me!</p>
